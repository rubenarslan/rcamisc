\usage{
take_nonmissing(df, keep = c())
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{dataset}

\item{keep}{defaults to empty vector}
}
\description{
this function takes a subset of a dataset, omitting all
cases with missings in variables specified in 'keep'
and omitting all variables that still have missings after that.
Good to see how large your dataset for a certain analysis
will be and which covariates are 'free' in terms of sample size.

ChickWeight[3:4,'Diet'] = NA
