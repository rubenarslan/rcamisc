\usage{
missingness_patterns(df, min_freq = ifelse(relative, 1/nrow(df), 1),
  long_pattern = FALSE, print_legend = ifelse(long_pattern, FALSE,
  TRUE), show_culprit = TRUE, relative = FALSE, omit_complete = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{dataset}

\item{min_freq}{show only patterns that occur at least this often. Defaults to 1 observation.}

\item{long_pattern}{by default (FALSE) only shows column indices for space and legibility reasons.}

\item{print_legend}{prints a legend for the column indices, defaults to FALSE if long_pattern is set}

\item{show_culprit}{defaults to TRUE. In case a missingness pattern boils down to one variable, it will be shown here.}

\item{relative}{defaults to FALSE. If true, percentages are shown (relative to total before excluding minimum frequency).}

\item{omit_complete}{defaults to TRUE. Columns that don't have any missings are excluded.}
}
\description{
this function shows how common possible missingness patterns are. Emulates misschk in stata.
\enumerate{
\item excludes any variables that don't have any missings, so as not to clutter output. Disable using omit_complete
\item sorts variables by number of missings, so that the usual suspects show up at the front.
\item displays number of missings accounted for by each pattern
